# Recommendation-system-NPO
Recommendation-system NPO

For the first assignment of the course Personalisation for (Public) Media, 
I developed a mid-fidelity prototype of an interface (e.g., built with Streamlit) that implements insights from value-sensitive design research. 
For the recommender system I chose the Nederlands publiek omproep (NPO).
